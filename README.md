# YelpCamp-MERN
YelpCamp is a full-stack application developed using the MERN stack. Originally it was developed with EJS and Express.js. Currently it is in the progress of migration into a React frontend application. The MongoDB database stores a set of campgrounds that can be added/removed by users authenticated and authorized through Passport.js.
